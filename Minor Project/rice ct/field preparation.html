                • When possible, plow immediately after the previous harvest - especially if the soil is still moist. You can also irrigate the field to soften the soil. Use a disc or mould-board plow to kill weeds and incorporate crop residue, preferably 6-8 weeks before planting, with a maximum recommended depth of 10 cm. Invert the soil for the required depth. The first harrowing is done along the plowing pattern to break the soil clods. Harrow the field 2-3 times at 5-7-day intervals. Apply lime once every three crop seasons for acid soils.<br>

               <h1>How to prepare the field</h1>
             <p>
                <b>In a Nutshell </b> <br>
                Proper field preparation is crucial for your harvest, and it is necessary for rice production to minimize competition with weeds. Here are the steps to follow.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>5 Steps</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                STEP 1<br>
                1) When possible, plow immediately after the previous harvest especially if the soil is still moist. You can also irrigate the field to soften the soil. Another option would be to release water by the canals to soften the soil.
First or primary plowing: Use a disc or moldboard plow to kill weeds and incorporate crop residue, preferably 6-8 weeks before planting with the maximum recommended depth (7-10 cm). Apply available compost or decomposted farmyard manure (FYM) farmyard manure at least one month before transplanting.
<br>
<br>
STEP 2<br>
2) Second plowing: Plow across the field with the disc or tine harrow at least twice to make small clod sizes. You can use a hand power tool or animal power (following picture).
Second plowing should be 2-3 weeks before planting. It is important to plough when the soil is very wet. This breaks up all of the soil structure and allows for proper puddling. Last harrowing should be 1 week before planting with maximum recommended depth (see below).  <br>
<br>
STEP 3<br>
2) Second plowing with animal power: Plow across the field with the disc or tine harrow at least twice to make small clod sizes. Second plowing should be 2-3 weeks before planting. It is important to plough when the soil is very wet. This breaks up all of the soil structure and allows for proper puddling. Last harrowing should be 1 week before planting with maximum recommended depth (see below). <br>
<br>
STEP 4<br>
3) Repair bunds/dikes, destroy rat burrows, repair any holes and cracks, and make the bunds compact. Bunds/dikes should be at least 0.5 m high and 1 m wide. 
<br>
<br>
STEP 5<br>
4) Leveling the field will give better water coverage, better crop establishment, and better weed control. </p>

   <h1>← Prepare a wet-bed nursery</h1>
   <h2>4 Weeks before seeding</h2>
   <p>
   
   <br>
   <b>In a Nutshell</b><br>
   Select and prepare a nursery site that is 1/10 the size of the intended planting area. By preparing your nursery with care, you can set a good foundation for the start of your rice production.<br>
   <br>
   <b>7 Steps</b><br>
   STEP 1<br>
Plow the nursery side once. Plow with minimum 7 cm depth and maximum 10 cm depth.<br>
<br>
STEP 2<br>
The nursery should be prepared with soils enriched with decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost. You could also apply chemical fertilizers. It is important to apply some kind of fertilizer before plowing (see below). Evenly spread the fertilizer prior to final plowing for seeding. Incorporate the fertilizer evenly into the soil, ensuring all the fertilizer is buried at least 2 cm below the surface. The right amount of fertilizer is indicated below. For Nitrogen fertilization, urea or neem coated urea can be used.<br>
<br>
STEP 3<br>
Plow the nursery a second time.<br>
<br>
STEP 4<br>
Harrow at least once in order to reduce clod sizes and take away stones from the surface.<br>
<br>
STEP 5<br>
Level the soil surface and put in drainage lines across the field.
<br>
<br>
STEP 6<br>
Precise leveling is crucial for proper plant stand.
<br>
<br>
STEP 7<br>
Prepare beds at 1 m wide by convenient length. Raise the soil to 5-10 cm height. Broadcast pre-germinated seeds in thoroughly puddled and levelled soil.

<h1>Second plowing</h1>
<h2>1 week before seedling</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Plow in the transverse direction using a two-wheel tractor with a rotary, or if you use buffaloes, use the traditional plow. Plowing will help to remove weeds and break large soil particles into smaller particles. Plow across the field with the disc or tine harrow at least twice.
In this step, you broadcast the fertilizer into the soil (just before transplanting) and till it lightly into the soil.
• Repair bunds/dikes, destroy rat burrows, repair any holes and cracks, and recompact the bunds.
• Bunds/dikes should be at least 0.5 m high and 1 m wide.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Leveling the paddy field</h1><br><br>
<p>
In order to level your paddy field properly, make sure to:<br>
• Level the field by using an animal-drawn wooden plank or a riding-type leveler.<br>
• Use a leveling harrower.<br>
• Remove excess water in the field before harrowing.<br>
• Apply a basal fertilizer mixture and harrow afterwards. The objective of adding fertilizer before harrowing is to allow the fertilizers to get mixed well into the soil. The major fertilizers that should be added include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.<br>
