        <h1>← Prevent yellow stem borers</h1>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p id="text"> 
                <br>
               <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
               Feeding damage at the base of the plant or along the central stem causes dead tillers at the vegetative stages ("deadhearts") and whitish unfilled panicles ("whiteheads") at the reproductive stages. After hatching, the larvae bore into the leaf sheath and feed on the inner surface of the stem. Tiny holes, frass, and fecal matter can be observed on the damaged plant tissues. To prevent yellow stem borers in your rice crop, be sure to:<br><br>
               • Raise the level of irrigation water periodically to kill the eggs.<br>
• Use nitrogenous fertilizers or manures moderately. Apply the fertilizers in split applications during the season.<br>
• Do not use broad-spectrum insecticides to fight pests, since this kills beneficial insects.<br>
• Control weeds in and around the field.<br>
• Harvest the crops at ground level to remove the larvae in stubble.<br>
• Remove stubble and plant debris, and destroy them after harvest.<br>
</p>
<h1>← Prevent and control sheath rot</h1>
<h2>Week 4</h2>
<p>
    
    
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    • Spots are characterized by gray centers and brown margins and often combine to form rotting and then discoloration of the leaf sheaths.<br>
• In severe infections, the young panicles may not emerge.<br>
• Affected leaf sheaths may have abundant whitish powdery fungal growth visible on the outer surface.<br>
• Grains of emerged panicles become discolored and sterile. Un-emerged panicles produce florets that turn red-brown to dark brown.<br>
• Infection is most damaging when it occurs at late booting stages and can cause severe damage.<br>
• Monitor the fields regularly for insects and pests like panicle mite and try to keep them under control.<br>
• Apply potassium, calcium sulphate, or zinc fertilizers at the tillering stage.<br>
• Remove infected stubble and weeds from the field will help.
</p>
<h1>← Biological control of gall midge</h1>
<h2>Week 5</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    The rice gall midge forms a tubular gall at
the base of tillers, producing elongated
silvery leaf sheaths called onion leaf or silver shoot (about 1 cm wide and 10-30 cm long). The affected tiller inhibits the growth of leaves and fails to produce panicles. Plant stunting, leaf deformity, wilting, and rolling are also symptoms caused by drought, potassium deficiency, salinity, and rice thrips. To prevent gall midge in your rice crop, be sure to:<br>
<br>
• Use a light trap along with a sticky board with oil or glue to collect the moths.<br>
• Remove all off-season plant hosts around the rice field. Keep the land fallow during the off-season.<br>
• Plant flowering plants that attract beneficial insects around the rice fields.<br>
• Check the optimum recommendation of nitrogen and potash fertilizer.<br>
• Plow ratoons of the previous crop immediately after harvest.<br>
</p>
<h1>Prevent rice stem rot</h1>
<h2>Week 6</h2>
<p>
    
    
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Initial symptoms are small, irregular black lesions on the outer leaf sheath near water level. The fungal growths empty the stem of its contents, leading to early lodging. At later stages of the disease, unfilled panicles and chalky grains are observed. To prevent stem rot in your rice crop, be sure to:<br>
    <br>
    • Drain the field to reduce proliferation.<br>
• Reduce nitrogen content and perform split applications.<br>
• Avoid stagnation of irrigation water.<br>
• Conduct weed control regularly.<br>
• Increase the content of potash to keep soil pH high.<br>
• Collect and burn any crop residue after harvest or let the straw decompose.<br>

</p>
<h1>← Control of rice bug</h1>
<h2>Week 7</h2>
<p>
    
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Immature and adult rice bugs both feed on rice grains and emanate a foul smell in the evening hours. They are actually found in all rice environments. Warm weather, overcast skies, and frequent drizzles favor their population build-up. They are more active at the beginning of monsoon and less active during the dry season. To prevent rice bug in your crop, be sure to:<br>
    <br>
    • Begin scouting the field daily at pre-flowering.<br>
• Remove other host plants such as crabgrass, goosegrass, and beans.<br>
• Preserve beneficial insects by spraying less insecticide.<br>
• Applications of fertilizer and water encourage rice to grow and develop.<br>
• Spray aromatic (like lemongrass) soap solution to expel the rice bug.<br>
• Use a mosquito net in the early morning or late afternoon to remove the rice bug, crush it, and put it in water then spray to expel other rice bugs.<BR>
• Encourage biological control agents: some wasps, grasshoppers, and spiders attack rice bugs or rice bug eggs.<br>
• Indiscriminate insecticide use disrupts biological control, resulting in pest resurgence.<br>

</p>
<h1>← Prevent rice blight and sheath blight</h1>
<h2>Week 8</h2>
<p>
    
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Symptoms of sheath blight include lesions on stalks (sheaths) near the water line that are oval, greenish-grey, 1-3 cm long, and water-soaked. These lesions grow irregularly and turn grey-white with brown margins. As the disease progresses to the upper parts of the plant, lesions appear and the whole leaf brightens.<br><br>
    • Careful use of nitrogen fertilizer and maintaining soil potassium levels helps in the management of this disease, and will likely minimize the need for fungicides.<br>
    • Excessive nitrogen levels can encourage sheath blight, kernel smut, and other diseases.<br>
• Carefully control weeds, especially on levees.<br>
• Drain rice fields relatively early in the cropping season to reduce sheath blight epidemics.<br>

</p>
<h1>← Prevention of brown spot</h1>
<h2>Week 9</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    The presence of circular or oval brown spots with a yellow halo during the tillering stage is the most visible sign of the infection. As they enlarge, a gray center develops in the middle of these spots and a reddish brown margin becomes visible. Discoloration of stems is another characteristic symptom. To prevent brown spot in your rice crop, be sure to:<br><br>
    • Ensure a balanced nutrient supply and monitor soil nutrients regularly.<br>
• Monitor fields for signs of the disease from the tillering stage.<br>
• For soils that are low in silicon, apply calcium silicate slag before planting.<br>

</p>
<h1>← Control of rice leaf roller</h1>
<h2>Week 10</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Longitudinal whitish and transparent streaks appear on the blade. The presence of disc-shaped ovoid eggs or of fecal matter are also signs of infection. To prevent rice leaf roller in your rice crop, be sure to:<br><Br>
        • Make use of light traps to attract and collect adults.<br>
• Protect and release of natural enemies, like egg parasitoid wasps (Trichogrammatidae), spiders, predatory beetles, frogs, dragonflies, and entomopathogenic fungi and viruses.<br>
• Spread neem leaves, a natural repellent, randomly in the field to deter adults from laying eggs.
Remove grassy weeds from fields and borders.<br>
• Flood and plow fields after harvest to remove crop residues.<br>
</p>
<h1>← Control brown planthoppers</h1>
<h2>Week 11</h2>
<p>
    
    
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Both nymphs and adults take refuge at the base of the plant and suck sap from the stems and leaves. Plants wilt and become discolored. High population density can cause leaves to first turn orange-yellow, then become brown and drying (hopperburn), and eventually the plant dries up and dies.<br><br>
    To control brown plant hopper, make sure to:<br>
• Use light traps such as electric bulbs or kerosene lamps near a light colored wall or over a pan of water.<br>
• Avoid indiscriminate insecticide use to favor beneficial insects.<br>
• Look for insects daily in the seedbed or in the field, on stems and the water surface.<br>
• Adopt alternate wetting and drying of the field to drown the insects.<br>
• Sweep small seedbeds with a net to catch the insects.<br>
• Remove weeds from the field and surroundings regularly.<br>
• Avoid overdosing nitrogen applications.<br>
• Allow alleyways of 20cm for every 2 meters in east-west direction during kharif and north-south direction in rabi.<br>
</p>
<h1>← Be aware of panicle mites</h1>
<h2>Week 12</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Feeding takes place behind the leaf sheath and can be detected by the presence of cinnamon to chocolate-brown blotches there. Panicle feeding results in sterility, deformed grains, straight head, and 'parrot-beaking' of grains. To prevent panicle mites in your rice crop, be sure to:
    <br><br>
    • Regularly monitor the field for symptoms of the mite.<br>
    • Use fertile soil with a balanced fertilization ratio.<br>
    • Rotate rice with bean or legume plants to break the life cycle of the mite.<br>
    • Maintain hygiene standards with all of the tools used in rice cultivation. Clean regularly.<br>
    • Make sure not to kill natural enemies of S. spinki on paddy fields (spiders, endoparasitoid wasps, etc.) through the overuse of insecticide.<br>
    • After harvesting, spread straw to burn before plowing the field. Leave the field fallow for two weeks after harvest.<br>
    

</p>
<h1>← Prevention and control of false smut</h1>
<h2>Week 15</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Orange, velvety globular masses of about 1 cm in diameter are visible on individual grains of the panicle. Later on, this spherical bag bursts open, and as it dries on the grains, it turns yellowish green or greenish black. To prevent false smut in your rice crop, be sure to:
    <br><br>
    • Alternate wetting and drying of the fields rather than permanent flooding (reduction of humidity).<br>
• Make a moderate use of nitrogen and divide it in split applications.<br>
• Monitor fields for signs of the disease.<br>
• Keep field bunds and irrigation channels clean.<br>
• Keep the field clean of weeds and remove infected plant debris, panicles, and seeds after harvest.<br>
• A deep plow and solarization of the field after harvest also helps to reduce the carry-over.<br>
• Plan a 2- or 3-year crop rotation with non-susceptible crops.<br>
