        <h1>← Threshing rice after harvest</h1>
        <h2>Week 19</h2>
        <p id="text"> 
                <br>
                To maintain the high quality of the harvested grains, they should be threshed immediately after harvesting. Let harvested rice straws and panicles that are wet from overnight rains or by the morning dew be field-dried before threshing (e.g. harvest in the morning and thresh in the afternoon). Use wide canvas or plastic sheets with the edges raised to catch all the grains being threshed through the beating.<br><br>
                Threshing can be done manually or mechanically:<br>
• The manual methods of threshing are treading by feet, the flail method, and beating stalks against tubs, boards, or racks. Threshing can be done by trampling using bullocks, rubbing with bare human feet (in hills), or lifting the bundles and striking them on the raised wooden platform. Pedal threshers are also used. <br>
• Mechanical threshing removes rice grains from the rice plant, speeds up threshing (thus reducing losses), and reduces labor requirements. Power-driven stationary threshers are also used.<br>
            </p>
            <h1>← Drying your rice crop</h1>
<h2>Week 20</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    Proper drying results in increased storage life of the grains, prevention of deterioration in quality, reduction of biological respiration that leads to quality loss of grains, and optimal milling recovery.<br><br>
    There are several ways in which you can dry your rice after harvest:<br>
• Sun drying is the most economical method of drying grains. Spread your drying grains on surfaces such as concrete pavement, mats, plastic sheets, or even on fields to dry them naturally.<br>
• Mechanical drying means drying the grains by ventilating natural or heated air through the grain mass to get the moisture out. Mechanical dryers are reliable, since drying can be done any time of the year.<br>
• Chemical drying involves the spraying of common salt solution with a specific gravity of 1.1 to 1.2 on the ears of the mature paddy crop. This treatment reduces the moisture content from 29% to 14.5% after four days.
Once dried, the rice grain, now called rough rice, is ready for processing.<br>

<h1>← Appropriate storage conditions</h1>
          <h2>Week 21</h2>
          <p>
            <br>
            Ideally, your harvest is stored in a place that meets the following criteria:<br>
            • Protection from insects, rodents, and birds.<br>
            • Good hygienic conditions.<br>
• Easy loading and unloading.<br>
• Efficient use of space.<br>
• Easy maintenance and management.<br>
• Prevention of moisture re-entering the grain after drying.<br>
