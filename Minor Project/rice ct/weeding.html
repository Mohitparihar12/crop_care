                • Plow and harrow in fallow field at least 10-14 days apart or after rain.<br>
• Since weeds have already germinated, they should be visible.<br>
• Apply permanent water early because weeds cannot germinate under water.<br>
• Remove weeds from your fields before applying fertilizers to your crops. Fertilizers would also feed undesirable weeds.<br>

            <h1>← About pre-emergence herbicides in rice</h1>
<h2>Week 1</h2>
 <p>
    
    <br>
    Some product recommendations:<br>
    • Two or three days after transplanting, mix any ONE of these herbicides in 60 kg of sand per acre and broadcast uniformly in 4-5 cm deep standing water.<br>
    • Butachlor 50 EC at 1200 ml per acre.<br>
    • Thiobencarb 50 EC at 1200 ml per acre.<br>
    • Pendimethalin 30 EC at 1000 ml per acre.<br>
    • Pretilachlor 50 EC at 600 ml per acre.<br><br>

Reminders when using herbicides:<br>
• Always mix clean water with herbicides
before application. Using muddy water will reduce the herbicide's efficacy.<br>
• Ensure that all equipment, such as spray tanks, booms, and nozzles are cleaned.
• well after every use.<br>
• Do not mix herbicides together, unless recommended.<br>
• Apply herbicides at the recommended rate.<br>
• Remember to wear proper protective equipment (ie., gloves, breathing mask, goggles, and protective clothing) when spraying.<br>
• Mixing the product is the time of greatest concern, as the product is in its most concentrated form.<br>
• When mixing the product, always stand upwind and wear protective clothing- especially face protection.<br>
• Wash contaminated clothes separately from other household clothes.<br>
• Clean blocked nozzles with a non-abrasive Implement. Never clean nozzles by blowing on them with the mouth.<br>
• Discard the containers properly.<br><br>
• Limitations of chemical weed control:<br>
• Herbicides are toxic substances, which if used unwisely or incorrectly, can cause health and environmental problems.<br>
• Herbicides are often weed-specific.
• Identify your weeds!<br>
• Weeds can develop herbicide resistance if farmers are too reliant on one type of herbicide. If necessary, alternate the use of suitable herbicides.<br>
• There is a drift risk to neighboring crops. Applicators require skills in application and calibration.<br>

 <h1>← Manual and mechanical weed control</h1>
 <h2>Week 3</h2><br>
 <p>

<b>In a Nutshell</b><br>
It is recommended to remove weeds the first 20-50 days after transplanting the crop in the main field. Repeat the weeding twice more during the crop cycle. Manual weeding is a part of integrated weed management that involves the use of cultural, manual and mechanical control methods.
<br>
<br>
<b>3 Steps</b><br>
STEP 1<br>
Weeds need to be controlled from planting until the ripening stage. Start hand weeding within two weeks of planting (or when weeds are large enough to grasp). You can also use a rotary weeder. Do not allow weeds to flower and set seeds in a crop field. Ensure that there is enough soil moisture for easy pull up of weeds.
<br>
<br>
STEP 2<br>
Weeds may survive if pulled and thrown in water. Remove the weeds from the field
<br>
<br>
STEP 3<br>
Some weeds can be used for animal fodder. If you are unsure talk to your neighbors.<Br>

<h2>Week 4</h2><br>
<p>
    
     For grassy weeds, you can apply within 15-20 days:<br>
     • cyhalofop-butyl 250-300 ml/acre.<br>
     • OR fenoxaprop-P-ethyl 200-250 ml/acre.<br>
     • For broadleaf weeds, you can apply within 25-30 days:<br>
     • 2,4-D sodium salt 500-600 gr/acre.<br>
     • OR 2,4-D ethyl ester (2,4-DEE) 1-1.25 lt/ acre.<br><br>
For weeds belonging to the Gramineae Family:<br>
• bispyribac-sodium 100ml/acre within 15-20 days.<br>
• OR cyhalofop-butyl 250-300 ml/acre AND metsulfuron methyl chlorimuron ethyl 8 gm/acre within 20-25 days.<br>
• Use the appropriate herbicide as recommended on the label for the identified weed.<br>
• Herbicides are poisonous to humans and animals.<br>
• Label them clearly and keep them out of children's reach.<br>
• Remember to wear proper protective equipment (l.e., gloves, breathing mask, goggles, and protective clothing) when spraying.<br>
• Spray when the weeds are small (3-4 leaves stage) and unstressed.<br>
• Always mix clean water with herbicides before application.<br>
Refrain from using muddy water, as this reduces herbicide efficacy.<br>
• Ensure that all equipment, such as spray. tanks, booms, and nozzles are well-cleaned after every use.<br>
• Do not mix different herbicides together uniess recommended.<br>
Apply herbicides at a recommended dose.<br>
