                Prior to transplanting your seedlings to the main field, chemical and biological control methods exist to control and prevent damage from of yellow stem borer:
                <br>
                <br>
                • Chemical Control: Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Soak the roots of the seedlings in 0.02% chlorpyriphos for 12-14 hours before transplanting to provide protection from the attacks of stem borer for up to 30 days. Pheromone traps may significantly decimate stem borer populations. Use resistant varieties. Monitor the seedbeds and fields regularly. Handpick and destroy egg masses in seedbeds and during transplanting.<br>
• Biological Control: Cutting the leaf-top before transplanting reduces the carryover of eggs from the seedbed to the field. Raising the level of irrigation water submerges the eggs deposited on the lower parts of the plant and also helps to control the populations.<br>
