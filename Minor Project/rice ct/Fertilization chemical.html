                <br>
                • Apply the suggested amount of nitrogen fertilizer after 10 days of seedling emergence.<br>
• The recommended amount of fertilizer is 16 kg of DAP per acre or 6.5 kg of urea per acre + 46 kg of super phosphate per acre.<br>
• Apply as a top dressing into your nursery.<br>
</p>
<h1>← Fertilization before transplanting</h1>
<h2>1 week before seedling</h2>
<p>
<br>
• Broadcast 10% of your available nitrogen evenly on your field, all of your phosphorus and potassium, and incorporate the fertilizers just before sowing or transplanting as a basal dose slightly into the soil.<br>
• Apply 6 kg of per acre of urea, 21 kg per acre of DAP and 23 kg per acre of MOP.<br>
• Do not use chemical fertilizer if you need more than a 5 kg paddy to pay for 1 kg of fertilizer. 
 Fertilizers must be stored in a dry, cool place that is out of children's reach.<br>
• Do not apply high rates of fertilizer for traditional varieties, as they may have limited response and cause lodging.<br><br>
Caution: Excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers, particularly during flowering, causes sterility. and consequently, a significant reduction in yield.<br>
</p>  
<h1>← Fertilization at tillering stage</h1>
<h2>Week 4</h2>     
<p>
    <br>
    • Apply one-third of the nitrogen as a top dress during the early tillering stage.<br>
• If you are using urea, then apply 25 kg per acre.<br>
• Apply less nitrogen if you are planting inbred seeds.<br>
• Drain out water before topdressing with nitrogen fertilizer, and let in water 24 hours later.<br>
• Apply the fertilizer by broadcasting as evenly as possible.<br>
• Do not apply fertilizers before the rain.<br>
• In established crops, apply chemical fertilizer only in standing water and evenly across the whole field.<br>
• Do not apply high rates of fertilizer for traditional varieties, as they may have limited response and cause lodging.<br>
</p>
<h1>← Fertilization at the panicle initiation stage</h1>
<h2>Week 9</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    • Apply the rest of the nitrogen dose a week before panicle initiation.<br>
