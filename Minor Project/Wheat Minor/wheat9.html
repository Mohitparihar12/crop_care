        <h1>Cultural control of seedbrone diseases</h1>
        <h2>1 Weeks before seedling</h2>
        <p>
            Preventive Measure.<br>

            There are several cultural control steps that you should take in order to reduce soil and seedborne pathogens, nematodes, foot rot, termites and resting stages of insects.<br>
            
            * Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure to discourage termite infestation.<br>
            
            * Avoid sowing crops late.<br>
            
            * For nematode infections: Plant non-host crops such as gram, mustard, cumin, carrots or onions for 3 years.<br>
        </p>
        <h1>Cultural termites</h1>
        <h2>1 Weeks before seedling</h2>
        <p>
            Preventive Measure<br>

            Cultural control:<br>
            
            * Deeply plough fields during the summer. Three summer ploughings at 10-day intervals reduce the juvenile population of termites.<br>
            
            * Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure to discourage termite infestation.<br>
            
            * Avoid sowing the crops late.<br>
            
            * For termites and shoot flies, destroy the crop residues that form the sources of infestation.<br>
            
            Mechanical control:<br>
            
            * Dismantle termitaria (termite mounds) around the field and kill the termite queen.<br>
            
            * Use crude oil emulsion to destroy the termite colony in the termatorium.<br>
        </p>
    <h1>Prevent nematodes in your plants</h1>  
    <h2>1 Week</h2>
    <p >
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Symptoms are very similar to drought stress or nutrient deficiency. Usually, plants show stunted growth and leaves turn yellowish with signs of wilting and deformation. Sometimes, knots or galls are present on roots. To prevent nematodes on your vegetables, make sure to:<br>
        
        * Use trap crops (e.g. clover) to attract nematodes away from your plants.<br>
        
        * Keep susceptible weeds in check, in the field and surroundings.<br>
        
        * Apply proper fertilization to optimize plant growth.<br>
        
        * Do not spread nematodes with equipment and tools.<br>
        
        * Plow and rid the field of plant residues after harvest.<br>
        
        * Cover the field with plastic mulch for several weeks (solarization).<br>
        
        * Practice a fallow period to break the life cycle of the nematode.<br>
        
        * Clean tools and tillage equipment after use.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent fall armyworm in your field</h1>
    <h2>2 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Young larvae eat leaf tissue from one side, leaving the opposite side intact. They might feed on seedlings until buds and growing points are destroyed. Larger larvae leave a characteristic pattern of perforations and ragged margins on the leaves. They might also attack the reproductive structures and young fruits. To prevent fall armyworm on your crop, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor for the presence of caterpillar for the first 6 weeks of plant growth.<br>
        
        * Monitor the moth's presence and mass-catch them with light or pheromone traps.<br>
        
        * Collect egg masses/larvae from crops/trap crops and destroy them.<br>
        
        * Weed control is recommended, in and around the field.<br>
        
        * Control insecticide use in order not to affect beneficial insects (ants, earwigs, ladybugs).<br>
        
        * Harvest early to avoid consistent damage.<br>
        
        * Plow the land to expose larvae and pupae.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent shoot flies in your fields of cereals</h1>
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        The maggot feeds on the shoots of young growing seedlings resulting in "dead hearts". Small circular cuts are often visible at the point of entrance on new shoots. Leaves turn yellowish-green and droop, seedlings are stunted. To prevent shoot flies in your cereals, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor fields for signs of the pest.<br>
        
        * Control insecticide use in order not to affect beneficial insects.<br>
        
        * Plan a good and balanced fertilization program.<br>
        
        * Avoid the application of farmyard manure after plant emergence.<br>
        
        * Remove weeds in and around the field.<br>
        
        * Do not to move soil from infested to healthy plots.<br>
        
        * Plan a crop rotation with non-susceptible crops after harvest.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent yellow stripe rust in your wheat plants</h1>
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        The fungus produces tiny, rusty pustules that are arranged in narrow stripes parallel to the leaf veins. These pustules can sometimes also be found on the stems and heads. The reduced leaf area leads to lower productivity, fewer spikes per plant and fewer grains per spike. To prevent yellow stripe rust in wheat, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor fields regularly for signs of the disease.<br>
        
        * Screen fields regularly for volunteer plants and remove them.<br>
        
        * Ensure adequate nitrogen fertilization and avoid excess nitrogen use.<br>
        
        * Plow and dig up crop residue deep in the soil after harvest.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent thrips in your plants</h1>
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Attacks by thrips are characterized by small silver patches on the upper side of leaves ("silvering") and marks on the fruit surface. Minute yellow or black insects 1-2 mm in length are visible on the underside of the leaves. To prevent thrips in your plants, make sure to:<br>
        
        * Remove the infected plant and any plant debris and destroy it.<br>
        
        * Control weeds in and around the field.<br>
        
        * Use sticky traps over a large area for monitoring of the infestation level.<br>
        
        * Keep plants well-irrigated and avoid excessive applications of nitrogen fertilizer.<br>
        
        * Plow and remove all plant waste after harvest.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Sulphur deficiencies</h1>
    <h2>4 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Remedies:<br>
        
        * Use sulphur-containing fertilizers, such as NPS, ammonium sulfate or calcium sulfate.<br>
        
        * Apply 100 kg of gypsum (calcium sulfate) per acre.<br>
        
        * Before sowing, to meet the sulfur requirement of the crop, apply 8 to 16 kg
        
        of sulphur per acre.<br>
        
        * When sulphur deficiency is detected in a standing crop, the addition of a readily soluble source (ammonium sulfate, potassium sulfate), even 40-45 days after sowing, can raise grain yields.<br>
        
        * Different fertilizers contain sulphur: Ammonium sulphate: 24%, phosphorus: 15%.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent aphids in your plants</h1>
    <h2>5 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Low to moderate numbers are usually not harmful to crops. Severe infestation can cause damage on leaves and shoots and stunted plant growth. Honeydew secreted by the aphids also leads to additional infections and worsening of symptoms. To prevent aphids in your plants, make sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor fields regularly for signs of aphid infestation.<br>
        
        * Hand-pick and remove infected plant parts.<br>
        
        * Not over-water or over-fertilize your crop.<br>
        
        * Control insecticide use in order to not affect beneficial insects.<br>
        
        * Control ant populations that protect aphids with sticky bands.<br>
        
        * Hold weeds in check, in and around the fields.<br>
        
        * Plow the field immediately after harvest to prevent their spread.<br>
        
        * Plan a rotation with resistant crops.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent wheat stem rust in your fields</h1>
    <h2>6 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Symptoms are characterized by reddish,
        
        oval and powdery pustules on stems, leaf
        
        sheaths and occasionally on leaves. The
        
        pustules grow and coalesce to cover large
        
        areas, giving the plant a rough appearance.
        
        Stems can be weakened and plants fall over
        
        in heavy winds and rain. To prevent wheat
        
        stem rust, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor fields regularly for any sign of the disease.<br>
        
        * Remove weeds, volunteer plants and species of berberis shrubs growing in the area.<br>
        
        * Thoroughly clean your tools, footwear, hands and trousers before entering another field.<br>
        
        * Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, particularly late in the season.<br>
        
        * Remove and destroy all plant residue to prevent survival of the fungus in field.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent powdery mildew in your cereal fields</h1>
    <h2>7 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        White, fluffy patches appear on leaves, stems and ears. In some crops, the patches can appear as large, raised pustules instead. These powdery zones turn gray-tan as the disease progresses. Late in the season, conspicuous black specks may appear amidst the white patches. To prevent powdery mildew of wheat, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor field regularly for first signs of the disease.<br>
        
        * Eliminate volunteer plants and weeds from the field to disrupt its life cycle.<br>
        
        * Manage carefully the application of nitrogen, as its excess in soil favors the growth of the pathogen.<br>
        
        * Complement the fertilization program with silicon or calcium silicate to strengthen the resistance of plants.<br>
        
        * Plan a crop rotation with non-host plants.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent karnal bunt of wheat in your fields</h1>
    <h2>9 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Symptoms are characterized by black and empty grains, partially or wholly filled by a black, powdery mass. The grain does not swell in the process, but as the disease progresses, more grains and spikes are affected. When crushed, these grains emit a smell of rotting fish. To prevent karnal bunt of wheat, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Improve field drainage and avoid excessive irrigation at the time of flowering.<br>
        
        * Avoid excessive fertilization with nitrogen during the late stages of plant growth.<br>
        
        * Restrict the movement of farm machinery and soil from contaminated fields.<br>
        
        * Implement a wide crop rotation with non-host plants for up to 5 years.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent wheat leaf rust in your fields</h1>
    <h2>Week 9</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Numerous small reddish orange to brown pustules appear on the leaves, leaf sheaths and husks. In vulnerable plants, tiny secondary pimples and a pale green or yellow halo are visible around the primary pustules. In more resistant wheat varieties, the orange pustules are smaller and surrounded by chlorotic or necrotic areas. In order to prevent leaf rust in your wheat plants, make sure to:<br>
        
        * Screen fields for volunteer plants from previous seasons and remove them.<br>
        
        * Ensure low crop density at planting to facilitate ventilation.<br>
        
        * Ensure adequate fertilization with nitrogen, but avoid excesses.<br>
        
        * Remove and destroy crop debris after harvest.<br>
        
        * Plan and implement a healthy crop rotation.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent mites in your crops</h1>
    <h2>10 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Mites feed on the underside of leaves, causing white or yellow speckles to form on the upper surface. They are usually surrounded by a dust-like layer made of eggs, nymphs, and webbing. To prevent mites in your plants, make sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor your field for signs of the pest and remove any affected plants.<br>
        
        * Also remove nettles and other weeds from fields.<br>
        
        * Control the use of insecticides to allow beneficial insects to thrive.<br>
        
        * Immediately remove plant residue after harvest.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent loose smut in your wheat fields</h1>
    <h2>Week 10</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Symptoms appear shortly before or during the flowering stage. They appear as blackened heads with powdery black grains and a peculiar "dead fish" odor. The developing kernels are replaced by fungal growth, and no grains develop in the infected heads. To prevent loose smut in wheat, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor fields regularly for signs of the disease.<br>
        
        * Make sure to clean tools, hands and footwear when working on different fields.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent helicoverpa caterpillar in your fields</h1>
    <h2>11 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        Symptoms include feeding damage on flowers and fruits/ears/pods during maturity stages. Damaged tissues may rot, worsening the symptoms. The larvae are often hidden within plant organs, making it difficult to treat with chemical products. To prevent Helicoverpa caterpillar in your crops, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor fields for signs of the pest (egg masses, damage).<br>
        
        * Hand-pick larvae and leaves or plants with eggs.<br>
        
        * Provide plants with balanced fertilization.<br>
        
        * Use light or pheromone traps to monitor or mass-catch the moths.<br>
        
        * Remove weeds in and around the field.<br>
        
        * Plow deep after harvesting to expose the insect for natural predators.<br>
        
        * Avoid monocultures and implement intercropping with beneficial plants.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent yellow stripe rust in your wheat plants</h1>
    <h2>Week 11</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        The fungus produces tiny, rusty pustules that are arranged in narrow stripes parallel to the leaf veins. These pustules can sometimes also be found on the stems and heads. The reduced leaf area leads to lower productivity, fewer spikes per plant and fewer grains per spike. To prevent yellow stripe rust in wheat, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Monitor fields regularly for signs of the disease.<br>
        
        * Screen fields regularly for volunteer plants and remove them.<br>
        
        * Ensure adequate nitrogen fertilization and avoid excess nitrogen use.<br>
        
        * Plow and dig up crop residue deep in the soil after harvest.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Prevent septoria tritici blotch in your wheat plants</h1>
    <h2>12 Weeks</h2>
    <p id="text">
        Preventive Measure<br>

        The disease is characterized by small chlorotic spots that initially appear on the lower leaves. As they enlarge, these spots become light to dark brown blotches with an oval or stripe shape. Tiny black spots appear within the lesions, and are visible up-close. Later, the lesions turn brown, enlarge, and engulf the whole leaf.<br>
        
        To prevent septoria tritici blotch in your wheat crop, be sure to:<br>
        
        * Regularly monitor the field for signs of the disease.<br>
        
        * Control volunteer crops and weeds in and around the field.<br>
        
        * Use nitrogen fertilizers at moderate levels.<br>
        
        * Plow deep to bury plant residues under the surface.<br>
        
        * Rotate with non-host plants for one or two years.<br>
