        • The wheat crop needs cool winters and hot summers. That is why the fertile plains of the Indo-Gangetic region are the most conducive for growing it.<br>

        • Wheat can be grown on all kinds of soil, for highly deteriorated alkaline.
        
          and waterlogged soils. • Wheat does not grow well in soils with high acidity pH greater than 5.5<br>
        
        • Though well-drained loam soils and clayey loams are considered the ideal soil for wheat, good crops of wheat have also been raised on sandy loams and the black soils of the peninsula region. Durum  wheat should preferably be sown on medium- to fine-textured soils.<br>
        • Wheat needs a cool climate during the early part of its growth. Warm temperatures at this stage are unfavorable for tillering and also promote several diseases.<br>
        
        • Too much rain during the season results in a heavy incidence of rusts and other foliar diseases.<br>
