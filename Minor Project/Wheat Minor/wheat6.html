        <h1>Applying post-emergence herbicides</h1>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p id="text">
            In addition to the many cultural weeding methods, chemical methods against weeds in wheat can be applied. Weeds of wheat can be controlled with the use of post-emergence herbicides. Most of the weeds in wheat are from the broad-leaf family.<br>
            Isoproturon (product) can be applied 2-3 days before the first irrigation takes place:<br>
            • On heavy-texture soils, use Isoproturon 75 WP at 500 g per acre.<br>

            •medium-textured soils, use Isoproturon 75 WP at 400 g per acre.<br>

            • Spray the herbicide by dissolving it in 200 litres of water with a knapsack sprayer fitted with a flat fan, or use a tractor-mounted sprayer.<br>

            •Spray patiently, and as uniformly as possible.<br>

             Irrigate lightly within 2-3 days of spraying the herbicide.<br>

             To control broad-leaf weeds, apply 2,4-D dimethylamine salt 58 EC 0.2 to 0.3 kg per acre 35-45 days after sowing wheat on time, or 45-55 days after sowing wheat late.<br>
        
             • Please take care: If gram, sarson or any other broad-leaf crop is sown in wheat, do not apply 2,4-D at all.<br>

             • If you have any doubts, please contact your local agricultural extension officer.<br>


             Please review the safety recommendations below before applying any herbicide:<br>
             • Always mix clean water with chemicals. Refrain from using muddy water, as this reduces the chemicals' efficacy.<br>

             • Ensure that all equipment, such as spray tanks, booms, and nozzles, are well-cleaned after every use.<br>

             • Do not mix different chemicals together unless recommended.<br>

             • Apply chemicals at the recommended rate.<br>

             • Remember to wear proper protective equipment (i.e., gloves, breathing mask, goggles, and protective clothing) when.<br>

             • Mixing the product is the time of greatest concern, as the product is in its most concentrated form. When mixing the product, always stand upwind and wear protective clothing - especially face protection.<br>

             • Wash contaminated clothes separately from other household cloths.<br>

             • Clean blocked nozzles with a non-abrasive implement. Never clean nozzles by blowing on them with the mouth.<br>
             
             • Discard the containers properly.<br>
            </p>   
        
    <h1>Manual or mechanical weeding</h1>
    <h2>Week 3</h2>
           
    <p id="text">
        • Perform the first hoeing before the first irrigation.<br>
        • Perform the second hoeing after the first irrigation e.g. with a wheel hoe.<br>

        • The types of weeds present in different areas of the wheat crop vary depending upon soil type and climate.<br>
        
        There are several measures that may minimize weed growth:<br>

        • The infestation gullidanda/sitti (phalaris minor) in wheat can be reduced by early sowing (last week of October/1st week of November) and by rotating wheat with berseem, a potato-based cropping system, raya, gob sarson, winter maize, etc.<br>

        • Growth and development of gullidanda can also be suppressed by sowing wheat at 15 cm spacing, or by selecting quick-growing wheat varieties like PBW 502, PBW 343 and WH 542.<br>

        • Preparation of soil mulch after seedbed preparation also helps in eliminating the first flush of Gullidanda.<br>

          Caution: Don't use a spade for weeding, as it may cause soil erosion.<br>
