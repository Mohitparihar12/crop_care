        <h1>Common classification in wheat:</h1>
        <h2>3 Weeks before seedling</h2>
        <p>
            • Emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum, Khapali wheat).<br>

            Like einkorn and spelt wheats, emmer is a hulled wheat. In other words, it has strong husks that enclose the grains, and a semi-brittle rachis. On threshing, a hulled wheat spike breaks up into spikelets. These require milling or pounding to release the grains from the husks. It contains 12-15% protein, 78-83% carbohydrates and 16% dietary fibers. It helps in reducing triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. It is used for making high-quality capati and special breakfast preparations like khir, shira and upma. It is also used for making processed food products like pasta, shewai, and Kuradi. Its price is double that of normal wheat and therefore is generally used for special preparations for wealthy people. This wheat is grown in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. It was developed from T. diccoides koru, a wild form.<br>
            • Macaroni wheat (Triticum durum).<br>

            Macaroni wheat is descendent of emmer wheat. It is drought-tolerant and cultivated in Punjab, M.P., Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, W.B and H.P. It is used for suji preparation. Durum wheat (Triticum durum) is preferred for the production of pasta or macaroni products, mainly because of its elevated level of yellow pigments and appropriate protein and gluten characteristics. Protein quantity and gluten quality are widely responsible for the so-called al dente pasta cooking characteristics, whereas yellow pigments and such oxidative enzymes as lipoxygenase (LOX), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) affect the color of pasta products.<br>
            • Common bread wheat (Triticum vulgare)

            This is typical wheat for the alluvial soils of the Indo Gangetic plains, i.e. Punjab, U.P., Bihar and parts of Rajasthan. The bulk of Indian crops consist of this type. It is a softer type that is used for flour in cakes, crackers, cookies and pastries. However, it is not cultivated on a large scale and not cultivated in Maharashtra.<br>

            • Indian dwarf wheat (Triticum spherococcum).<br>

            This wheat is found in limited areas of M.P. and U.P. in India and in Pakistan. It is characterized by very short and compact heads with shorter grains. Indian dwarf wheat belongs to the club wheat of Western countries.<br>
            • Bread Wheat (Triticum aestivum).<br>

            This is the type presently grown in India in almost all the wheat-growing zones. It is bread wheat. It is also called Mexican dwarf wheat. Bread wheat grains contain per 100 g edible portion: water 12.8 g, energy 1377 kJ (329 kcal), protein 15.4 g, fat 1.9 g, carbohydrate 68.0 g, dietary fibre 12.2 g, Ca 25 mg, Mg 124 mg, P 332 mg, Fe 3.6 mg, Zn 2.8 mg, vitamin A 9 IU, thiamin 0.50 mg, riboflavin 0.11 mg, niacin 5.7 mg, vitamin B6 0.34 mg, folate 43 µg and ascorbic acid 0 mg. It is used for bread as well as chapatti/ roti in major wheat-growing areas.<br>
