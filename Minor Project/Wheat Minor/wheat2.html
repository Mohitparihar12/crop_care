        <p id="text">

            Depending on your sowing time and conditions, choose the right amount of seeds:<br>

            • Normal conditions: 40 kg of seeds per acre.<br>

            • Late sowing: 50-60 kg of seeds per acre.<br>

            • Rainfed conditions: 30-40 kg of seeds per acre.<br>

            • Make furrows of 5 cm deep in lines spaced 25cm apart.<br>

            • Place the seeds in the soil no more than 8cm deep.<br>

            • Seeds placed deeper than 8cm results in reduced emergence, leading to poor crop stand, while seeds placed too close to the surface are unable to acquire enough moisture for germination.<br>

            • Immediately after seeding, cover the seed with fine soil.<br>

        <h2>2 Weeks before seeding</h2>
        <p> 

            • The sowing time for wheat in rainfed areas is very important.<br>

            • Early sowing during the last week of October or first week of November allows the seeds to imbibe more water for germination due to sufficient moisture in the seeding zone.<br>
            
            • Moreover, temperatures near 25°C during this period support rapid germination for a vigorous crop stand.<br>
            
            • optimal timing is important for better tillering and optimal use of nutrients for vegetative and reproductive growth, resulting in increased productivity.<br>
            
            • The sowing of rainfed wheat crops should be carried out in the 2nd week of October.<br>
             <br>
           
            The sowing time for rainfed wheat in different wheat growing zones are as follows:<br>

            • 15-21 October: Northern Hills Zone (NHZ) - Western Himalayan regions of J&K (except Jammu and Kathua dist.); H.P. (except Una and Paonta valley;) Uttarakhand (except Tarai area); Sikkim and hills of West Bengal and NE states<br>

            • 15-31 October: Central Zone (CZ) - MP, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Udaipur and Kota divisions of Rajasthan and Jhansi division of UP<br>

            • 15-31 October: Peninsular Zone (PZ) - Maharashtra and Karnataka, the plains of TN, AP and Goa<br>

            • 20-31 October: North Western Plains Zone (NWPZ) - Punjab, Haryana, Delhi Rajasthan (except the Kota and Udaipur divisions) Western UP (except Jhansi division), the Tarai regions of Uttarakhand, Paonta valley and the Una district of HP, the Jammu and Kathua district of J&K,<br>

            • 25 October - 10 November: North Eastern Plains Zone (NEPZ) - East UP, Bihar,Jharkhand, West Bengal (excluding hills), Orissa, Assam and the plains of the NE states.<br>

     <h1>Sowing Wheat.</h1>    
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p id="text">
        The following land machinery can be used for sowing:<br>

        • Seed drills with 3-4 coulters.<br>
        
        • Seed-cum-fertilizer drills sow the seeds and place fertilizer behind the seeds at the same time. Apply seeds and fertilizers in separated columns/ furrows to avoid the risk of poor germination due to direct contact between seed and fertilizers.<br>
        
        • Behind a local plough: This method consists of dropping the seeds, by hand or with a special attachment, into the furrows that have been opened by a local plough. In this method, seeds are dropped off at a depth of 5-6 centimeters and germination is satisfactory.<br>
        
        • Broadcasting: Sometimes after harvesting sugarcane and cotton crops, soil becomes hard and sticky, and proper land preparation cannot be completed. In that case, seeds are directly broadcasted and light ploughing is done.<br>
        Proper planting is important. If you plant too deep, your crop will take longer to emerge, giving the weeds a head start, which is particularly bad if you weren't planning on spraying with herbicide.<br>
