        <h1>Time to dry and shell your maize cobs</h1>
        <h2>Week 20</h2>
        <p id="text">
            • Harvested cobs are brought home and dried on the floor.<br>

            • Keep the cobs in the sun for a few days for drying, and to bring moisture below 12 percent.<br>
            
            • The relative humidity of the ambient air must not be higher than 70 percent. For that reason, the grain must not be exposed at night.<br>
            
            • Protect the drying cobs from birds, rats, insects, and animals.<br>
            
            • When you harvest maize in a small quantity, shell it manually.<br>
            
            • If manual shelling is not an option, there are several shell machines available on the market.<br>
            
            • After shelling, the grain can be dried for another 2 to 3 days, cleaned and stored at below 10 percent moisture.<br>   
        </p>
        <h1>Cleaning and storing grain</h1>
        <h2>Week 20</h2>
        <p id="text">
            • Separate the grain for home consumption, sales, and storage.<br>

            • The cleaned and dried grain should be stored in metal bins, super green bags or locally built moisture-proof stores.<br>
            
            • The grain is mixed with neem to protect it from weevils, moths, and fungus in storage. The neem is an azadirachta indica tree. Its leaves have insecticidal properties, and therefore, they are mixed with grains of a wide number of crops to prevent attacks from pests.<br>
        </p>
        <h1>Appropriate stroge conditions</h1>
        <h2>Week 21</h2>
        <p id="text">
            Ideally, your harvest is stored in a place that meets the following criteria:<br>

            • Protection from insects, rodents, and birds.<br>
            
            • Good hygienic conditions.<br>
            
            • Easy loading and unloading.<br>
            
            • Efficient use of space.<br>
            
            • Easy maintenance and management.<br>
            
            • Prevention of moisture re-entering the grain after drying.<br>
