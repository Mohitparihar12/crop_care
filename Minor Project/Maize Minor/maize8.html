        <h1>Fertilize during sowing</h1>
        <h2>week 1</h2>
        <p id="text">
            Apply chemical fertilizers as basal fertilization during sowing:<br>

            • 12 kg per acre of urea.<br>
            
            • 28 kg per acre of P205 (DAP or SSP).<br>
            
            • 28 kg per acre of K2O (MOP).<br>
            
            • 10 kg per acre ZnSO4 (Zinc Sulphate).<br>
            
            Example: If you have 3 acres, you will need to apply 36 kg of urea in total, in addition to 84 kg of DAP, 84 kg of MOP and 30 kg of Zinc Sulphate.<br>
            
            Please consider that fertilizer dosages can vary depending on your soil type.<br>
            
            Full doses of P, K and Zn should be applied as basal, preferably drilling of fertilizers in bands 5-7 cm to the side of the seeds using seed-cum-fertilizer drills or a two-bowl bullock- or tractor-drawn seed drill. The dosages can vary based on your soil type.<br>
             </p>
             <h1>Nitrogen split fertilization at 6 leaves</h1>
             <h2>week 4</h2>
             <p id="text">               
                Once your maize plants have developed 6 leaves, apply 33 kg per acre of urea. It will be more efficient if you apply side dressing. If is not possible, broadcast the fertilizer.<br>

                Example: If you have 3 acres, you will need to apply 99 kg of urea in total. Please consider that fertilizer dosages can vary depending on your soil type.<br>
                
                Rapid nitrogen uptake by the maize plant begins about 5 weeks after germination (30-40 days) and will continue for about 4-6 weeks. Nitrogen fertilizer needs to be available during these stages.<br>
                
                </p>
                <h1>Nitrogen split fertilization at 10 leaves</h1>
                <h2>week-6</h2>
                <p id="text">
                    • Once your maize plants have developed 10 leaves, apply 39 kg of urea per acre.<br>

                    • You can either apply side dressing or broadcast the fertilizer.<br>

                     Example: If you have 3 acres, you will need to apply 117 kg of urea total. Please consider that fertilizer dosages can vary depending on your soil type.<br>

                     Rapid nitrogen uptake by the maize plant begins about 5 weeks after germination (30-40 days) and will continue for about 4-6 weeks. Nitrogen fertilizer needs to be available during these stages.<br>

                <h1>Nitrogen split fertilization at tasseling</h1>
                <h2>week-9</h2>
                <p id="text">
                    Apply 26 kg of urea per acre at this time in your cropping cycle. You can either apply side dressing or broadcast the fertilizers.<br>

                    Example: If you have 3 acres, you will need to apply 78 kg of urea in total.<br>

                    Please consider that fertilizer dosages can vary depending on your soil type.<br>
                    Maize produces a tassel of silks at the top of each ear when the plants are ready to start producing. The tassels produce the pollen that pollinates the ears so they can form the kernels. This stage is crucial for your later harvest.<br>

                <h1>Nitrogen split fertilization at grain filling</h1>
                <h2>week-13</h2>
                <p id="text">
                    Apply 7 kg of urea per acre. This application is optional. You can either apply side dressing or broadcast the fertilizers.<br>

                    Example: If you have 3 acres, you will need to apply 21 kg of urea in total.<br>
                    Please consider that fertilizer dosages can vary depending on your soil type.<br>
