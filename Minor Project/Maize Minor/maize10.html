            The appearance of the plant may be misleading, particularly in the case of high-yielding composites and hybrids whose grains are dry while the stalk and leaves may be still green.<br>

            • The maize crop raised for grain is harvested when the grains are nearly dry and do not contain more than 20% moisture.<br>
            
            • Harvest your crop when 90% of the total cobs are dry.<br>
            
            • Remove ear heads or cobs from the standing crop.<br>
            
            • Harvested ear-heads cobs are dried in the sun. Harvest the whole plants and pile them, and remove the ear heads later.<br>
            
            • Removed grains from cobs by hand shelling or using a mechanical maize sheller.<br>
            
            • Use maize stalks as a cattle feed and fuel.The stover/cobs from which the grains are removed are also used as a fuel.<br>
            • No part of the maize plant is left unused.<br>
            
            • The fodder maize is harvested at 50% flowering stage, which produces maximum yield or dry matter with fairly nutritious forage.<br>
