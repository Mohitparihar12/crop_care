        <h1>Irrigation your crop regularly</h1>
        <h2>Weeks 2</h2>
        <p id="text">
            In regions with about 60cm of well-distributed rainfall during the growing seasons,additional irrigation is not necessary.<br>
        • The total amount of irrigation will depend on the rainfall distribution pattern.<br>

        • The spring and rabi crops are entirely raised under irrigation. The amount of irrigation varies.<br>

        • For winter maize, it is advisable to keep the soil wet (frequent & mild irrigation) from 15 December to 15 February to protect the crop from frost injury.<br>

        • Irrigate the field just up to saturation level and do not flood the field.<br>

        • In general, the irrigation should be applied in furrows up to the 2/3rd height of the ridges/beds.<br>

        • Irrigate the field with about 5-7.5cm.<br>

        • Irrigation is done in the furrow between the two rows of plants.<br>

        • Irrigate before each of the two top dressings.<br>

        • The critical times for irrigation are the knee hight stage (V8), the tasseling stage, silk initiation in the cob and the milking stage of the grain.<br>

             <h1>Water your plants during flowering</h1>
             <h2>week-9</h2>
             <p id="text"> 
                • Flowering and post-flowering are the most susceptible stages for moisture stress.<br>

                • Irrigate your crop with approximately 5-7.5 cm of water.<br>

                • Irrigate again if there is inadequate soil moisture during the flowering and post-flowering (i.e. grain filling) stages.<br>
