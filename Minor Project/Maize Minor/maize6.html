            Here is some general information about the effects of weeding that might be interesting to you:<br>

            • In the first few weeks after emergence, maize is more sensitive to weeds.<br>

            • The first weeding and hoeing should be done 20-25 days after planting.<br>

            • The second weeding should be done when plants are knee height (40-50 days after planting).<br>

            • Earthing up is done up to 5 cm high simultaneously during weeding and hoeing. Earthing up loosens the soil and supports the plant from lodging.<br>

            • Generally, weeding is done by hand, although machines are available for weeding mechanically.<br>

            • While weeding and earthing up, take precautions to minimize the physical damage to crop plants.<br>

            • Weeds can be used for composting and animal forage.<br>
            • While using herbicides, always read and follow the instructions on the product label. Use the right herbicide at the recommended rate and store it in an appropriate way.<br>

            • Take advice from extension workers for further guidance.<br>

                The use of herbicides can help prevent and control the spread of weeds in your fields when used properly. Pre-emergence weeding consists of applying herbicides before the weeds are present to avoid their growth. Here are some recommendations:<br>

                • Three to five days after sowing, atrazine-based weedicide can be applied at a rate of 100 grams per acre, diluted in 200 liters of water.<br>

                • Always read the label carefully and take precautions when applying the product.<br>

                • Herbicides are poisonous to humans and animals.<br>

                • Label them clearly and keep them out of children's reach.<br>

                • Remember to wear proper protective equipment (i.e., gloves, breathing mask, goggles and protective clothing) when spraying.<br>

                • Ask your extension officer or local retailer which pre-emergence herbicide is best-suited for your purposes.<br>
                • Always mix clean water with herbicides before application.<br>

                • Refrain from using muddy water, as this reduces herbicide efficacy.<br>

                • Ensure that all equipment, such as spray tanks, booms, and nozzles are well-cleaned after every use.<br>

                • Do not mix different herbicides together unless recommended.<br>

                • Apply herbicides at a recommended dose.<br>

                    The use of herbicides is sometimes the only practical way to control some weeds, but it is essential to identify the weed in question and use the right product. Here are some recommendations:<br>

                    • For broadleaf weeds, products based on 2,4-D sodium salt can be applied at a rate of 200-300 grams per acre.<br>

                    • Always address your local or regional agricultural extension officer.<br>

                    • Use the appropriate herbicide as recommended on the label for the identified weed.<br>

                    • Herbicides are poisonous to humans and animals.<br>

                    • Label them clearly and keep them out of children's reach.<br>

                    • Remember to wear proper protective equipment (i.e., gloves, breathing mask, goggles and protective clothing) when spraying.<br>

                    • Spray when the weeds are small (3-4 leaves stage) and unstressed.<br>
                    • Always mix clean water with herbicides before application.<br>

                    • Refrain from using muddy water, as this reduces herbicide efficacy.<br>

                    • Ensure that all equipment, such as spray tanks, booms, and nozzles are well-cleaned after every use.<br>

                    • Do not mix different herbicides together unless recommended.<br>

                    • Apply herbicides at a recommended dose.<br>
