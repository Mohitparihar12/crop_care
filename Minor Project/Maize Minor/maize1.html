            • Full season maturity: Genotypes mature at 105-110 days or more. They are either rainfed or irrigated. E.g.: Ganga-5, Ganga-9, Ganga -2, Deccan 103, Shakti, Proagro 311.<br>

            • Medium maturity: Varieties need 95-100 days to mature and suit well to regions. Examples: Vikram - high tolerance to drought and downy mildew (90-95 days), Vijay - resistance to foliar diseases.<br>
            
            • Early maturity: Varieties need 89-90 days to mature. Suitable either in monocropping or intercropping with assured rainfall.<br>

            • Very early maturity varieties: Require 75-80 days. They are suitable as summer crops or for intercropping under rainfed conditions. Example: Diara, Diara-3, and D765, African tall takes 60-70 days and is only used for fodder production.<br>

            • Extra-early maturing: Suitable for cultivation under rainfed conditions at a very high altitude (>2500 m). The growing season is very short and the temperature is relatively low. Example: Composite Auli.<br>
