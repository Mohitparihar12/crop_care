        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p id="text"> 
            • Watermelon is a dry season crop and must be irrigated.• Watermelon is a dry season crop and must be irrigated.<br>
            • The first irrigation is done 2 days before planting.<br>
            • The second irrigation is done 5 days after sowing the seeds.
            Continue irrigating once a week.<br>
            • While irrigating, water must be restricted to the root zone of the plant.<br>
            • Wetting of vines or other vegetative parts of the plant must be avoided especially during flowering or fruiting time to avoid damages to the flowers, fruits or even the plant as a whole.<br>
            • Wetting of the vegetative parts can also lead to the development of fungal diseases.<br>
            • Maintain moisture near the roots so that the plants develop a central dominant root system.<br>
            • Reduce the irrigation frequency as the fruits mature and completely stop irrigating during the harvesting stage. This helps develop flavour and sweetness in the fruit.<br>
