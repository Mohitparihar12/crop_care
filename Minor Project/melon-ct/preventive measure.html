        <h1>Prevent angular leaf spot disease in your crop</h1>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p id="text"> 
<b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
The symptoms are caused by bacteria, which can infect all cucurbit crops. The disease causes the following symptoms:<br>
• Small, circular spots on leaves.<br>
• Later large, angular to irregular, water-soaked areas.<br>
• Infected areas turn gray, fall off, and create irregular holes.<br>
• Circular spots on fruits, later turning white and cracking open.<br><br>
To prevent angular leaf spot disease in your crop, make sure to:<br>
• Monitor the fields regularly for signs of the disease.<br>
• Clean tools thoroughly after field work.<br>
• Use furrow irrigation instead of sprinklers and do not overwater.<br>
• Remove and destroy infected or suspicious plant material.<br>
• In infected areas, do not plant cucurbits for at least 3 years.<br>

            </p>
            <h1>Prevent leaf miners in your plants</h1>
            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Preventive Measure </b><br>
                When leaf miners are present, white or grey serpentine leaf tunnels are visible on leaves, between the two epidermises. A thin, dark streak or dotted dark line is sometimes visible inside the tunnels, more conspicuous from the underside. Leaves may be deformed, twisted, or curled, but remain green. To prevent leaf miners, make sure to:<br><br>
                • Monitor the field regularly for signs of leaf miner infestation.<br>
                • Remove infected plants and plant parts and destroy them by burning.<br>
                • Apply mulch around plants to prevent the insects from breeding in the soil.<br>
                • Use yellow sticky traps or yellow basins filled with water to drown them. They are attracted to the color yellow.<br>
                • Practice thorough weed control in and around the field during the season.<br>
                • Do not use broad-spectrum insecticide that could affect natural enemies.<br>
                • Plow deep after harvest to expose the miners to natural enemies.<br>
                • Burn infected plant parts and destroy possible hosts such as old crop debris.<br>
                • Plan a crop rotation with non-susceptible crops.<br>

            </p>
            <h1> Prevent aphids in your plants</h1>
            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
                Low to moderate numbers are usually not harmful to crops. Severe infestation can cause damage on leaves and shoots and stunted plant growth. Honeydew secreted by the aphids also leads to additional infections and worsening of symptoms. To prevent aphids in your plants, make sure to:<br><br>
                • Monitor fields regularly for signs of aphid infestation.<br>
• Hand-pick and remove infected plant parts.<br>
• Not over-water or over-fertilize your crop.<br>
• Control insecticide use in order to not affect beneficial insects.<br>
• Control ant populations that protect aphids with sticky bands.<br>
• Hold weeds in check, in and around the fields.<br>
• Plow the field immediately after harvest to prevent their spread.<br>
• Plan a rotation with resistant crops.<br>

            </p>
            <h1>Prevent powdery mildew in your crops </h1>
            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
                Powdery mildew mainly affects lower leaves. but can also appear on any above-ground plant part. As the disease progresses, the mildew gets denser and spreads up and down the length of the plant. Environments with high humidity favor the disease. To prevent powdery mildew, make sure to:<br><br>
                • Use a mulch to prevent the spreading from the soil up onto the leaves.<br>
• Monitor your plants regularly for signs of the disease.<br>
• Remove infected leaves when the first spots appear.<br>
• Do not touch healthy plants after touching infected plants.<br>
• Fertilize with balanced nutrient supply, avoiding excess nitrogen.<br>
• Plow in or remove plant residue after harvest.<br>

            </p>
            <h1>Prevent cucumber mosaic virus in yoyr crop</h1>
            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
                The damage is caused by the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), which is transmitted through aphids. It causes the following symptoms:<br>
• Yellow mosaic patterns on leaves and fruits.<br>
• Downward-bending and crinkling leaves and petioles.<br>
• Stunted and deformed growth.<br>
• White streaks on flowers.<br><br>
To prevent cucumber mosaic virus make sure to:<br>
• Monitor fields and remove plants with signs of the disease.<br>
• Remove any weeds that show the mosaic pattern.<br>
• Remove other alternative hosts, growing
near your crops.<br>
• Ensure disinfection of tools or equipment used for vegetative propagation.<br>
• Attach a floating cover to exclude migrant aphids during the early weeks of crop growth. Remove the cover after this period of greatest vulnerability has passed to ensure pollination.<br>
• Plant barrier crops that will attract aphids.<br>
• Use sticky traps to mass-catch the aphids.<br>


            </p>
<h1> Prevent alternaria black spot and fruit rot in your crop</h1>
<h2>Week 7</h2>
<p>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Black spot and fruit rot symptoms can be created by many fungi of the alternaria family and are characterized by the appearance of small reddish-brown spots on fruits and leaves. The spots are surrounded by a green-yellow halo. As the disease progresses, these spots become bigger and form patches that can cover up to half of the fruit surface. Leaves become dry and may drop prematurely.<br><br>
    To prevent alternaria black spot and fruit rot in your crop, make sure to:<br>
• Provide good drainage to the fields.<br>
• Monitor your plants for any sign of disease especially during the flowering period.<br>
• Fertilize your crop properly to increase the plant's natural resistance.<br>
• Collect all the affected fruits and destroy them via burning.<br>
• Infected, healthy-appearing fruit may drop to the ground by gently shaking the tree at the time of harvest.<br>
• Remove old fruits and dead branches from the field.<br>
</p>
<h1>Prevent melon fruit fly in your crop</h1>
<h2>Week 8</h2>
<p>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b>
    The melon fruit fly causes the following symptoms in your plants:<br>
• Rotting and premature dropping of fruits.<br>
• Small discoloured patches on fruits.<br>
• Seedlings, roots, stems and buds can also be attacked.<br><br>
To prevent melon fruit fly in your crop, make sure to:<br>
• Monitor the field regularly by using traps.<br>
• Plough the soil regularly to either expose pupae to the sun or bury them deeply.<br>
• All unharvested crops should be buried at least 0.5 m deep to ensure the death of the entire maggot population.<br>
• Do not transport contaminated crops to other locations.<br>
</p>
<h1>Prevent red pumpkin beetle in your crop</h1>
<h2>Week 9</h2>
<p>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Symptoms of the red pumpkin beetle are:<br>
• Large feeding holes on leaves.<br>
• Deep holes on the roots and underground stems.<br>
• Rotting and withering of roots and stems.<br><br>
To prevent red pumpkin beetle damage in your crop, make sure to:<br>
• Cover seedlings with polythene bags to protect them against beetle damage.<br>
• Ensure good conditions for healthy plant growth, such as adequate nutrients, manure and watering using furrow irrigation.<br>
• Monitor fields once a week for feeding damage and use yellow sticky traps.<br>
• Handpick beetles early in the morning when they are still slow.<br>
• Keep your field free of alternate host weeds.<br>
• Collect and burn or bury the plant debris.<br>
• Plough deeply during the summer to disturb and expose the beetle during its hibernating stage.<br>
</p>
<h1>Prevent thrips in your plants</h1><br>
<h2>Week 10</h2>
<p>
    <b>Preventive Measure</b><br>
    Attacks by thrips are characterized by small silver patches on the upper side of leaves ("silvering") and marks on the fruit surface. Minute yellow or black insects 1-2 mm in length are visible on the underside of the leaves. To prevent thrips in your plants, make sure to:<br><br>
    • Remove the infected plant and any plant debris and destroy it.<br>
• Control weeds in and around the field.<br>
• Use sticky traps over a large area for monitoring of the infestation level.<br>
• Keep plants well-irrigated and avoid excessive applications of nitrogen fertilizer.<br>
• Plow and remove all plant waste after harvest.<br>
</p>
<h1>Timing and harvesting techniques</h1>
<h2>Week 14</h2>
<p>
    • Fruits only mature when they are still attached to the vine.<br>
• The fruit is mature when the tendrils near the stem start drying and the white coloured part of the fruit touching the ground turns yellowish.<br>
• Another sign of maturity is when a thudding sound is produced when the melons are thumped (a dense sound is produced from immature fruits).<br>
• Ripe fruits are harvested by cutting the stem 3 cm away from the fruit with a knife or sharp pruners.<br>
• Immature fruits must be left untouched and not removed.<br>
</p>
        <h1>Seed saving techniques</h1> 
        <h2>Week 16</h2> 
        <p>
            If you are planning on harvesting some fruits to keep the seeds for next year, here are some recommendations:<br>
• Seeds should be collected only from healthy-looking fruits.<br>
• Only mature seeds should be collected.<br>
• The optimum time to collect seeds is at least 1 week after fruits are ready for harvest for market sale.<br>
• To help determine the optimum time for seed collection is when the tendril has withered on the shoot bearing the fruit.<br>
