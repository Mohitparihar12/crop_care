                In watermelon plants, male and female flowers grow on the same plant, but, separately. The male flowers are smaller in size and appear first while female flowers are very large and appear later. The female flowers have a small fruit at the base. In case it shrivels, it means there would be no pollination. In nature, bees carry the pollen while hopping from flower to flower gathering nectar. Therefore, setting up an artificial beehive in the watermelon field is a good idea. One beehive per acre of watermelon field is more than enough.

            <h1> Manual pollination of flowers</h1>
<h2>Week 8</h2>
<p>
    <b>In a Nutshell</b><br>
    Plants from the Cucurbitaceae family such
as cucumber and watermelon produce
both male and female flowers on the same
plant. The female flowers will produce fruit
only when pollen from the male flowers
come in contact with the female flower.
Pollination can be done by bees or other
nectar seeking insects. If your production is
in a polyhouse and/or the number of
pollinating insects is low, you should
proceed to manual pollination. Follow these
steps for manual pollination:<br>
<br>
<p>
    <b>4 Steps</b><br>
    STEP 1<br>
Manual pollination should be done in the early morning when the flowers open. First, pluck a male flower.<br>
<br>
STEP 2<br>
Gently remove the petals around the male flower.<br><br>
STEP 3<br>
Gently brush the stamen of the male flower (the part which contains pollen) against the stigma of the female flower (the part which is at the centre of the flower). This helps the pollen stick to the female flower. Use 1 male flower to pollinate a maximum of 4 female flowers. Repeat manual pollination a few days after new flowers appear and open.<br><br>
STEP 4<br>
Locate the male and female flowers. Female flowers have a small immature fruit attached to them. The male flowers do not have a small immature fruit attached to them.
