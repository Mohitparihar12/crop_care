        <h1>Prevent termites in your fields</h1>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>

        <p id="text">
            <b>Preventive Measure</b> <br>
            Symptoms of termites include wilting of young or older plants and often lodging and presence of termites and tunnels around and in the roots. Roots and the base of the stem are also hollowed out. To prevent termites in wheat, be sure to: <br> <br>
            • Inspect plants regularly, early in the morning or late in the afternoon. <br>
            • Remove and destroy affected plants or part plants. <br>
            • Promote conditions for healthy plant growth, for example, balanced fertilization. <br>
            • Avoid water stress and unnecessary injury to the plants. <br>
            • Harvest early if possible, as termites often attack the crops left over in the field after maturity. <br>
            • Remove plant residues and other debris after harvest.  <br> 
            • Plow fields to destroy termites' nests and tunnels and to expose them to predators, such as ants, birds, chickens. <br>
            • Practice crop rotations or grow in fields with intercrops.
        </p>
        <h1>Prevent leaf miners in your plants</h1>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>
         <b>Preventive Measure</b>
         When leaf miners are present, white or grey serpentine leaf tunnels are visible on leaves, between the two epidermises. A thin, dark streak or dotted dark line is sometimes visible inside the tunnels, more conspicuous from the underside. Leaves may be deformed, twisted, or curled, but remain green. To prevent leaf miners, make sure to: <br> <br>
         • Monitor the field regularly for signs of leaf miner infestation.
Remove infected plants and plant parts and destroy them by burning. <br>
• Apply mulch around plants to prevent the insects from breeding in the soil. <br>
• Use yellow sticky traps or yellow basins filled with water to drown them. They are attracted to the color yellow. <br>
• Practice thorough weed control in and around the field during the season. <br>
• Do not use broad-spectrum insecticide that could affect natural enemies. <br>
• Plow deep after harvest to expose the miners to natural enemies. <br>
• Burn infected plant parts and destroy possible hosts such as old crop debris. <br>
• Plan a crop rotation with non-susceptible crops.
        </p>
                <h1>Prevent aphids in your plants</h1>
            <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Preventive Measure</b> <br>
            Low to moderate numbers are usually not harmful to crops. Severe infestation can cause damage on leaves and shoots and stunted plant growth. Honeydew secreted by the aphids also leads to additional infections and worsening of symptoms. To prevent aphids in your plants, make sure to:  <br> <br>
            • Monitor fields regularly for signs of aphid infestation. <br>
            • Hand-pick and remove infected plant parts. <br>
            • Not over-water or over-fertilize your crop. <br>
            • Control insecticide use in order to not affect beneficial insects. <br>
            • Control ant populations that protect aphids with sticky bands.
            • Hold weeds in check, in and around the fields. <br>
            • Plow the field immediately after harvest to prevent their spread. <br> 
            • Plan a rotation with resistant crops.
        </p>
        <h1>Prevent thrips in your plants</h1>
        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Preventive Measure</b>
            Attacks by thrips are characterized by small silver patches on the upper side of leaves ("silvering") and marks on the fruit surface. Minute yellow or black insects 1-2 mm in length are visible on the underside of the leaves. To prevent thrips in your plants, make sure to: <br><br>
            • Remove the infected plant and any plant debris and destroy it. <br>
            • Control weeds in and around the field. <br>
            • Use sticky traps over a large area for monitoring of the infestation level. <br>
            • Keep plants well-irrigated and avoid excessive applications of nitrogen fertilizer. <br>
            • Plow and remove all plant waste after harvest.  <br> 
        </p>
        <h1>Prevent leafhoppers and jassids in your crops</h1>
        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Preventive Measure</b>
            <br>
            Symptoms of leafhoppers and jassids begin with dead areas on leaf blades around the feeding points, followed by yellowing at the edges of leaves, and sometimes curled leaves. To prevent leafhoppers and jassids in your crops, be sure to: <br> <br>
            • Monitor by searching for empty larval skins on leaf undersides. <br>
            • Hand-pick and remove eggs or infected plant parts. <br>
            • Alternatively, use yellow sticky traps that are very attractive to green leafhoppers. <br>
            • Try to promote a good environment for beneficial insects such as ladybugs and lacewings. 
        </p>
        <h1>Prevent white grubs in your fields</h1>
        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p><b>Preventive Measure</b>
        Both adults and larvae damage the plants. Grubs feed on fine rootlets and nodules. Adults attack flower structures and pods. Affected plants are yellowish and wilted and die in patches. In annuals, sudden wilting is the earliest symptom. Plants that are attacked by adult beetles defoliate. To prevent white grubs in your plants, make sure to: <br><br>
        • Monitor fields for signs of the pest. <br>
        • Remove infested flowers, pods or plant parts by hand. <br>
        • Install light traps at the onset of rains and monitor the number of beetles per day. <br>
        • Collect and destroy white grub around the field, preferably in the morning. <br>
        • Use green manure such as Italian ryegrass or legumes to conserve natural enemies.  <br>
        • Apply potassium as a base fertilizer to strengthen root systems and increase tolerance to grub damage. <br>
        • Plow deep in late autumn and in spring before planting. <br>
        • Fallow the fields for two years. Rotate crops with non-host plants (paddy rice).

    <h1>Prevent helicoverpa caterpillar in your fields</h1>
    <h2>Week 8</h2>
    <p><b>Preventive Measure</b>
        flowers and fruits/ears/pods during maturity stages. Damaged tissues may rot, worsening the symptoms. The larvae are often hidden within plant organs, making it difficult to treat with chemical products. To prevent Helicoverpa caterpillar in your crops, be sure to: <br><br>
        • Monitor fields for signs of the pest (egg masses, damage). <br>
        • Hand-pick larvae and leaves or plants with eggs. <br>
        • Provide plants with balanced fertilization. <br>
        • Use light or pheromone traps to monitor or mass-catch the moths. <br>
        • Remove weeds in and around the field. <br>
        • Plow deep after harvesting to expose the insect for natural predators. <br>
        • Avoid monocultures and implement intercropping with beneficial plants.
