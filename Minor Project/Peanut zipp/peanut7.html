        <h1>Make an irrigation plan for your leguminous crops</h1>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p id="text">Water supply is particularly important during three stages of crop growth: germination, flowering stage and pod/ seeds development. Here are some recommendations on how to prepare an irrigation plan so that your plants are vigorous and healthy. Remember that the exact quantity applied will depend on the type of soil, variety and the weather. <br> <br>
            • The initial irrigation after sowing must be substantial in order to favor seed-soil contact and the moisture of the seeds. <br>
            • Another irrigation can be planned 3-5 days after that, depending on soil moisture and water availability. <br>
            • If there is no rain, fields should be irrigated regularly (every 7-15 days) during the vegetative stage. <br>
            • After this, the plants should be irrigated at the beginning of the flowering stage. <br>
            • The last irrigation event should be during pod development to secure yields. <br>
            • Under no circumstances should you overwater, as leguminous crops are very sensitive to flooding. <br>
            • Note that when 80% of pods are dry, plants should be left to dry for about 20-25 days before harvesting. <br>
        </p>
        <h1>Irrigation during critical growth phase</h1>
        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p>• Flowering, peg penetration, and early pod formation are the moisture-sensitive phases of groundnut growth. <br>
            • The pegs cannot enter the soil if the soil surface is hard due to prolonged dry-spell. <br>
            • The early phase of pod setting is especially sensitive to water deficit. <br>
            • Provide some irrigation to your crop to avoid reduction of pod yield, in case of drought.</p>
