        <h1>Storing your peanut crop</h1>
        <h2>Week 16</h2>
        <p id="text">
            The pods should be stripped off, cleaned and spread on the floor for drying under mild sunshine. After drying, the pods are ready for sale and should be stored in polythene bags. After proper drying, the kernel will split into two cotyledons if pressed with the thumb and index fingers and the pods should be kept in polythene lined gunny bags.

            <h1>Where to store legume seeds to avoid losses</h1>
            <h2>Week 16</h2>
            <p>Seed moisture and the temperature of the storage room will determine how long seeds can be stored without losing their viability. However, there are other factors that may cause losses, such as diseases, pests (for example bruchids), bad storage facilities, wrong practices, etc. Here are some recommendations to prevent losses during the storage of your black gram seeds. <br> <br>
                • Make sure to store seed bags in an enclosed room with no access for insects or rodents. <br>
                • If necessary, consider the option of improving your storage facilities. <br>
                • In general, rudimentary storage structures, made up of rice straw, bamboo splits and mud bricks are not optimal. <br>
                • "Pusa bins" are improved storage structures and need popularization. <br>
                • Consult organizations/public institutions around you for improved storage facilities.
            </p>
            <h1>Standardization of your leguminous seeds</h1>
            <h2>Week 16</h2>
            <p>In the market, your leguminous seeds are going to be classified according to variety, size, and quality following a series of norms and standards. The advantage of having clean and uniform produce, free of foreign objects and weeds is that: 
                 <br><br>
                 • The producer gets a good and standard price for the product. <br>
                 • The consumers are satisfied with the quality of the product they get. <br>
                 • Products of similar grade can be stored in big quantities at one place and for a longer time. <br>
                 • Good storage increases the longevity of the seeds and the opportunity to fetch a good price.   
            </p>
            <h1>Make sure you know where to sell your harvest</h1>
            <h2>Week 16</h2>
            <p>A long series of possibilities are available for marketing and selling your produce. Make sure to know who you should contact (merchant, commission agent, shipper, middleman, retailer) and what the possible expenses for market or fair fees, storage and transport could be. Here are some places where you could sell your harvest: <br><br>
                • Local markets in surrounding villages. <br> 
                • Local fairs organized regularly. <br>
                • Agricultural markets (mainly in cities and urban areas). <br>
                • Cooperative societies (membership). 
                <br>
                • Governmental purchase through agencies. 
                <br>
