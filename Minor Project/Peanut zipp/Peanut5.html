        <h1>Prepare fields well in advance of sowing date</h1>
        <h2>2 Weeks before seeding</h2>
        <p id="text">The major difference between rainfed fields and irrigated fields is that the latter needs more work in terms of field preparation, for example, the formation of ridges and furrows to facilitate irrigation. When preparing the fields, make sure to follow the recommendations listed below: <br>
            • Carry out a good plowing with a tine attachment or rotavator at a depth of 35 cm to incorporate the remaining plant debris and weeds into the soil. <br>
            • Collect small stones and crop stubbles from the field to facilitate good seed-soil contact at sowing. <br>
            • Later on, harrow the field 3-5 times to reduce clod size and compaction, and obtain a fine and loose tilth. <br>
            • Add farmyard manure during the last plow (5-10 tons/acre). Make sure to mix it well with the soil. <br>
            • Level and drain the field properly to avoid flooding problems.    <br>
            • For irrigated land, prepare ridges and furrows separated by the appropriate distance. <br>
            • Divide the field into smaller plots at your convenience to facilitate the irrigation. 
        </p>
        <h1>Planting systems for peanut</h1>
        <h2>2 Weeks before seeding</h2>
        <p>There are several ways to sow peanuts: sowing on a flat surface or using a ridge-and-furrow system, or a broad bed-and-furrow system. The broad bed-and-furrow system has multiple benefits over the other two systems: <br>
            • Better control of soil moisture and good drainage of excess water. <br>
            • Better control of weeds through intercultural operations. <br>
            • Less compaction of soil facilitates rooting. <br>
            • Adapted for plastic mulching. <br>
            • Easier mechanical harvesting. <br> <br>
           <b> How to prepare a broad bed and furrow system: </b><br>
            • Prepare beds of 1.2m wide and 15-20cm high. <br>
            • Beds should be spaced 30cm apart. <br>
            • In the Kharif season, beds should be formed in the same direction as the slope (parallel). <br>
            • In the Rabi season, beds should be formed in the opposite direction of the slope (perpendicular).
        </p>
        <h1>Using mulch in peanut production</h1>
        <h2>1 week before seeding</h2>
        <p>Both polythene mulching and organic mulching in groundnut have been proven to improve production. <br>
            • Polythene mulching has been found to be effective in increasing the yield, seed oil content, protein content, and the level of eight other compounds in the seed. <br>
                • When grown under polythene mulch system, groundnut is sown approximately 10 days earlier and it matures about 10 days earlier than under non-mulched condition. <br>
                • Polythene mulching increases the soil temperature and therefore shortens the crop period. <br>
                • During the hot season, it also protects the soil from direct sunlight. <br>
                • It also helps by retaining soil moisture, improving soil texture and in controlling weeds. <br>
            • A polythene film of a thickness of 0.007 mm is optimum and more economical. <br>
            • Additionally, rice straw applied as mulch was also found to be effective for improving the productivity groundnut.
        </p>
        <h1>Start preparing fields again soon after harvest</h1>
        <h2>Week 17</h2>
        <p>During the summer months, just after your previous harvest, think about plowing the soil deep to dig plant residues and thus break the cycle of many insects, diseases and weeds. Field sanitation is also important. The roguing and destroying of weeds and volunteer plants will prevent the carry-over of major diseases to the next season.</p>
