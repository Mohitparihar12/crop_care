        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p id="text">
            • To prevent the germination of weed seeds in your field, you can use pre-emergence herbicides. <br>
            • You may choose to apply Pendimethalin 30% EC at the recommended rate of 800 ml per acre mixed in 100-2001 of water. <br>
            • Spray within 2 days after sowing. <br>
            • Use a hand-operated sprayer fitted with a deflecting or fan-type nozzle. <br>
            • Target the bottom of the furrows and avoid ridges. <br>
            • Make sure that sufficient moisture is present in the soil at the time of herbicide application. <br>
            • Make sure that the product is well incorporated in the soil. <br>
            • Follow up with a mechanical weeding at 40-50 days after sowing to effectively control weeds in your field. <br>
            • Ask your extension officer or cooperative about the best product for your specific case. <br>

        <h1>Managing weeds for peanut crop</h1>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>
            • Control of weeds within 2-3 weeks of sowing not only prevents exhausting the nutrients from the soil but also conserves moisture and helps with the quick growth of leguminous crops. <br>
            • One hoeing and earthing up is recommended at 25 days after sowing, followed by a hand weeding at 35 days after sowing. <br>
            • If applying pre-emergence herbicides, follow up with one mechanical weeding at 40-50 days after sowing to effectively control weeds.</p>
