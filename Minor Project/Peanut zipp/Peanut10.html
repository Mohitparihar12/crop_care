        <h1>Time to harvesting</h1>
        <h2>Week 14</h2>
        <p id="text">
            It is very important to harvest groundnuts at optimum maturity to reduce the post-harvest losses and to maintain the quality of the product under long-term storage conditions. <br><br>
            • The easiest and most practical method to determine pod maturity is to look at the internal hull colour. <br>
            • Darkening of the internal surface of the hull is directly related to seed maturity. <br>
            • When 75-80% pods show internal hull darkening, it means the crop is at the optimum maturity. <br>
            • Both early, as well as late harvesting, can result in substantial loss. <br>
            • Due to its indeterminate growth habit, pod maturity is not uniform in groundnut. <br>
            • If one waits for all the pods of a plant to mature, the seeds in early-formed pods, in some cases, start sprouting due to lack of seed dormancy, or pod walls start disintegrating due to attacks of fungi and other pathogens. 
        </p>
        <h1>Drying and threshing pods</h1>
        <h2>Week 14</h2>
        <p>At harvesting, groundnut pods generally contain about 35% moisture, which must be brought below 7% to provide optimal storage conditions. The harvested plants are well shaken to dislodge the soil from pods and are left in the field for 2-3 days for initial drying before stripping. In the post-rainy season, when higher temperatures (40-45°C) prevail at the time of harvesting, the pods must be stripped immediately and dried under shade. Both mechanical and manual threshing is common. In the case of small yield, the harvested plants are taken home for pod stripping and drying. It is important to remove all damaged (physical, insect and nematode), rotted and sprouted pods from the harvested produce as they reduce the quality and are a source of contamination of diseases and insect pests in the storage area.</p>
