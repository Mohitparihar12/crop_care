        <h1>How to add micronutrients to your plants</h1>
        <h2>Week 9</h2>
        <p>Secondary nutrients and micronutrients are usually added after a soil test or after the detection of a deficiency in your crop. Boron, iron, zinc, manganese, and calcium are the most common compliments. The addition can be done as a side dressing (mixed with sand) at the base of the plant, or as a foliar spray. This will depend on the nutrient itself, the weather conditions, and the severity of the deficiency. Here are some more recommendations on the products that you can use:
            <br>
            • Calcium can be added in the form of calcium nitrate or calcium chloride solutions (3 g/l). <br>
            • Magnesium is sprayed in the form of magnesium sulphate solutions (3 g/l). <br>
            • Iron is sprayed as ferrous sulphate solutions (2 g/l). <br>
            • Boron is usually applied to soils before seed sowing in the form of borax (800g/ acre), mixed with sand. <br>
            • Zinc is usually sprayed as zinc sulphate solutions (2 g/l). <br>
            • Molybdenum is usually sprayed as sodium or ammonium molybdate solutions (2 g/l). <br>
            • Ask your extension officer or local retailer which micronutrient mixture best-suited for your purposes.
