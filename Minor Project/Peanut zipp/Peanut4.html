            <h1>Optimal growing conditions for peanut</h1>
            <h2>3 Weeks before seeding</h2>
            <p id="text">• Groundnuts are the third most important oilseed in the world. <br>
                • It is an important source of protein grown mostly under rain-fed conditions. <br>
                • The favourable temperature range for growing peanut is 21-27°C during the crop growth period. <br>
                • Temperatures below 18°C and higher than 35°C will reduce germination and flower initiation. <br>
                • Peanut plants thrive with rainfall ranging from 700 to 1000mm. <br>
                • Optimal soils for production are well-drained, light-textured, loose and friable soil, with reasonably
                high calcium levels, moderate organic matter, and a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0. <br>
                • Heavy and soils high in clay content are unsuitable for cultivation as the pods cannot properly
                develop in these soils.</p>
            <h1>Rotate crops properly</h1>
            <h2>Week 17</h2>
            <p>Crop rotation is the practice of growing different crops in the same field in sequential seasons. This
                helps to increase soil health and fertility, and also avoids the carry-over of some diseases. The
                simplest rule of thumb is to grow an above-ground crop and then a below-ground crop, but avoid crops of
                the same families. <br> <br>
                Here are some groups of crops with recommended rotations: <br>
                • Nightshades: tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, capsicums, chilies, and eggplants <br>
                • Cole crops: cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, and kale. <br>
                • Root crops: beetroot, carrots, parsnips, salsify, and turnips. <br>
                • Legumes: beans, peanuts, grams, and peas (highly recommended to replenish nitrogen levels) <br>
                • Other crops: Swiss chard, spinach, leek, celery, lettuce, endive, and artichokes can be included
                anywhere, unless they make a bad companion.
                <br><br>
                Strict crop rotation is obligatory after having grown peas, potato, cucumber, cabbage, carrots,
                parsley, and onions.
