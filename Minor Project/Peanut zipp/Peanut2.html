        <h1>Chemical seed treatments</h1>
        <h2>1 Weeks before seeding</h2>
        <p id="text">Many of the seeds acquired by farmers
            have been previously treated to avoid a
            series of diseases. If this is not the case,
            peanut seeds can be treated or "coated"
            with the following chemical products to
            protect them from diseases and pests. Here
            are some recommendations:
        <br>
        • Against fungal diseases such as collar rot, solutions containing thiram (3 g/ kg of seed), carbendazim (2g/ kg of seed) or mancozeb (2 g/ kg of seed) can be applied and will confer protection for up to 3 weeks. 
        <br>
        •  After the treatment, seeds should be left to dry in the shade for about 30 minutes to an hour
    </p>
    <h1>Rhizobium seed treatment</h1>
    <h2>1 Weeks before seeding</h2>
    <p id="text">
        <h3>In a Nutshell</h3>
        If you are cultivating a leguminous crop for the first time, treat seeds with Rhizobium bacteria to improve the absorption of nitrogen during the season and increase yields at harvest. The application of Rhizobium may save you 20 to 25% of the required nitrogen during the season. Check the expiration date on the packet when acquiring powders (short validity) and make sure to carry out the procedure explained below for successful inoculation of your seeds.
    </p>
    <h2>6 Steps</h2><br>
<h3>STEP 1</h3>
    <p>Prepare a 10% sugary solution to stick the Rhizobium bacteria to the seed surface. This solution is made by mixing 50 g sugar or gur to 500 ml of water.</p>
        <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    <P>Dissolve the sugary solution by warming for about 15 minutes and then make sure to cool it down to room temperature.</P>
  <h3>STEP 3</h3>
  <p>Empty and dissolve the ready-made Rhizobium culture into the cooled sugar solution (200-400 g of powder/acre). Mix thoroughly so as to obtain uniform slurry.</p>
  <h3>STEP 4</h3>
  <p>Pour slurry over the seeds in a container and make sure to mix thoroughly while doing so. Keep on mixing till all seeds are evenly covered.</p>
  <h3>STEP 5</h3>
  <P>Spread the treated seeds over gunny bag/ paper cloth or even cement/solid surface for drying in the shade (important). Do not expose the inoculated seeds to high temperature, dry wind and hot sun.</P>
  <H3>STEP 6</H3>
  <p>After the seeds are dry, collect them in bags and prepare for sowing. If inoculated seed can not be sown on the same day of inoculation, repeat treatment again before sowing.</p>
        <h1>Method of planting</h1>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>Seed rate and spacing will vary depending on the type of variety <br>
            • For bunch type varieties, use a seed rate of 40-50 kg per acre and a spacing of 30 cm between rows and 10-15 cm between plants. <br>
            • For semi-spreading varieties, use a seed rate of 38-40 kg per acre and a spacing of 30 cm between rows and 15-20 cm between plants. <br>
• When sowing on a broad bed- and furrow system, peanuts seeds are sown in 4 rows per bed with 30cm between rows and 10cm between plants. <br>
• Planting depth is around 5-8 cm deep. <br>
• Use a dibbler or seed drill for planting.
